    <p class="texto">Electronic voting machines guarantee secure voting, quick calculations and incorruptible results and perform one of the most computerized voting in the
        world, however electronic voting machines have a useful life of 10 years and cannot be used again after that time.<br><br>
    As a way of ensuring that in addition to bringing a good result in the elections, the machines also brought environmental benefits, the TSE (Superior Electoral Court
     in portuguese), started to hire companies to carry out the recycling of this material, as well as batteries, coils, medias and
     drives.<br><br>
    The company is hired through bidding process and the chosen company undertakes the collection of the machines throughout the country, dismantle,
    separate and crush the material, according to the rules established in the contract, which even include the size of the pieces of each piece to be
    crushed.</p><br>

    <p class="texto">The recycling procedure has no costs to the Electoral Court, all stages of disposal are paid by the company, that also pays to the
        public coffers R$ 0.88 per kilo of material destroyed.<br><br>
        The entire process of releasing the machines is monitored by TSE teams, among the procedures made, they weigh the truck that will
        carry out the transport while still empty and then it is weighed again after being loaded, after this procedure the truck is sealed
        by the TSE technicians and is only opened again at its final destination, this is made to ensure that there will be no deviation of material, as no
        piece can be found outside the domain of Electoral Justice.<br><br>
        Also to ensure that there will be no diversion of official equipment, the first step is to de-characterize all the material,
        then the material is separated and crushed, and then at least 95% of it is destined for recycling, with the requirement that 100% of the material
        has an ecologically correct destination, in this way, even the material that cannot be recycled, which must be at most 5% of the total, must be
        destined for appropriate landfills for each type of material.<br><br>
        The power cables that connect the voter terminal to the clerk station's terminal, made of rubber mixed with plastic, are transformed into soles.
        of women's shoes and sandals, plastic foams that form part of the machines' packaging are transformed into stuffing for puffs and in some
         discards the plastic from the voter and clerk station terminals were transformed into motorcycle fairings, the cover that protects the engine.<br><br>
         In addition, motherboards and other boards can be sold by the contracted company to other companies in Europe and Asia, generating profit for the company.
         company even after it paid for the urn recycling process. <br><br>
        According to calculations, it is possible to extract 150 grams of gold from a ton of motherboards, so these parts go through an extraction process, in which
         noble components such as gold, silver, platinum and copper are removed and can be used in the production of new electronic components.</p><br><br><br>
